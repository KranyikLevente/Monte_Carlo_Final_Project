# Monte_Carlo_Final_Project
The repository for the final project of the Monte Carlo Methods subject


Task
"You will have to write a program that simulates gamma photons using Monte Carlo methods and produces an estimated gamma spectrum, for different monoenergetic sources. Furthermore you will have some tasks on analysing how the efficiency depends on the source position and energy."
